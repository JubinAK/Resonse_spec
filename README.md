Elastic Response Spectrum:
Plot for the maximum response of SDOF system that is subjected to specified earthquake ground motion against mostly its time period is called the response spectra. Response spectrum is normally interpreted as the locus of maximum response of a SDOF system for given damping ratio. Therefore, response spectra help in obtaining the peak structural responses under linear range, that can be used for obtaining lateral forces developed in structure due to earthquake and hence facilitates in the earthquake-resistant design of structures.
For a given time period of system, maximum response is selected. This process is continued for all ranges of possible time periods of SDOF system. Eventually, a plot with the time period of the system on x-axis and the response quantity on y-axis is the required response spectra.  The spectra belong to a fixed damping ratio and input ground motion. The same process is adopted with different damping ratios to get the overall response spectra. The response spectrum provides a convenient and practical way to summarize the frequency content of a given acceleration, velocity or displacement time history.
Here I have varied the Tn from 0.1 sec to 8 sec and obtained the max. response for each mentioned time period.
